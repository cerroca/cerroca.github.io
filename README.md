# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio project where I showcase my work and skills. Below are the details and instructions for setting up and viewing the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Open `index.html`**: To view your portfolio, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can do this by right-clicking the file and selecting "Open with" and then choosing your preferred web browser.

2. **Make Changes**: If you make changes to your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files, save them and refresh the browser to see the updates.

3. **Using SCSS**: If you are using SCSS, ensure to compile it into CSS before viewing the changes in the browser. You can use a tool like Sass for this purpose.

4. **Local Server**: Optionally, set up a local server using tools like the Live Server extension in your code editor. This will allow you to automatically refresh the page when you make changes.
